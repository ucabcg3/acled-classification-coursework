# AI for SD Coursework - Predicting if Women are Targets of Political Protests

Coursework as part of the Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Development module. We were asked to choose a dataset related to sustainable development and do some machine learning-based analysis. I chose the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) to try and classify if a political protest/event would lead to women being specific targets.

This was a binary classification task, where I preprocessed the data myself, trained a variety of classic Machine Learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XG Boost, and analyzed the performance mainly using F1 score and confusion matrices.
